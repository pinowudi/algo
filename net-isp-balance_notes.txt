## Net::ISP::Balance configuration file
## edit it as needed to describe your router setup

## This table defines the LAN and IP services.
## Uncomment by removing hash symbols (#) and then edit as needed

## service    device   role     ping-ip            weight  gateway
WAN1          wg1     isp      1.1.1.1      1       default

# The mode controls whether to operate in "balanced" mode in which traffic
# is distributed among the isp services proportional to the weights, or "failover"
# mode in which all traffic is routed through the highest weighted service and
# switches to lower-weighted services only when the higher one(s) are unavailable.
mode=balanced
#mode=failover

## The "forwarding_group" option gives you fine control over how
## packets are forwarded.  See the online docs for details.  :lan
## means all interfaces marked as "lan" :isp means all interfaces
## marked as "isp" the default (shown below) allows forwarding among
## all lan and isp interfaces

forwarding_group=LAN2 :isp

## The options below are passed to lsm, among others.
## the defaults are shown. To change them, uncomment
## and edit.
